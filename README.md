## Log

### Day 1

I found out about the [`slice::windows`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.windows) method in Rust, which enables both parts of today's puzzle to be solved with functional programming.

For **part 1**, it's as simple as iterating the entries with a window of size `2`, and then folding the result:

```rust
measurements.windows(2).fold(0, |total, window| {
  total + if window[1] > window[0] { 1 } else { 0 }
})
```

For **part2** we need to first create triplets (which are windows of size `3`), and then iterate over the list of triplets as if they were windows of size `2`, to be able to access both the current triplet and the previous one:

```rust
let triplets: Vec<&[u64]> = measurements.windows(3).collect();
triplets.windows(2).fold(0, |total, window| {
  // ...
})
```

### Day 2

I created an enum type to handle the different commands. This implements the trait `std::convert::From` to parse a string into a command. Overengineering? Yes, but‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

```rust
pub enum Command {
  Forward(i64),
  Up(i64),
  Down(i64),
}

impl From<&str> for Command {
  fn from(raw: &str) -> Self {
    // ...
  }
}
```

For **part 1**, running the commands is as simple as do a `match` over that enum:

```rust
fn exec(&mut self, cmd: &Command) {
  match cmd {
    Command::Forward(delta) => self.x += delta,
    Command::Up(delta) => self.y -= delta,
    Command::Down(delta) => self.y += delta,
  }
}
```

For **part 2**, a new logic for handling the commands is introduced, plus a new variable into the state of the submarine (`aim`). So I decided to play with Rust traits a bit and have two different types for the different "submarines", each one implementing a trait that provides the `exec` method:

```rust
pub trait Submarine {
  fn exec(&mut self, cmd: &Command);
  fn run(&mut self, input: &[Command]) {
    // ...
  }
}

pub struct SubmarineV2 {
  x: i64,
  y: i64,
  aim: i64,
}

impl Submarine for SubmarineV2 {
  fn exec(&mut self, cmd: &Command) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
### Day 3

Today's puzzle was a good opportunity to refresh bit shifts and masking in Rust.

For **part 1**, the key of my solution is this loop:

```rust
for i in 0..n_bits {
  let mask = 2_u32.pow(i);
  let ones = report.iter().filter(|x| *x & mask == mask).count();
  if ones > report.len() / 2 {
      gamma_rate += mask
  }
}
```

Let's say we want to get the value of the second bit (counting from the left) for a number, for instance `01110`. We would need to build a mask that is `01000` so when we do and `AND` operation with those two we can get whichever value was at the position of the masking bit.

For **part 2**, we use the same masking idea and keep filtering down the numbers until we have only one left.
